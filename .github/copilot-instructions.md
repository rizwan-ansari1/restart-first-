# Copilot Instructions for This Codebase

## Overview

This is a simple static web project consisting of three files:

- `a.html`: Main HTML file containing the page structure and inline JavaScript event handlers.
- `a.css`: Stylesheet for page and element styling.
- `a.js`: Intended for JavaScript logic, but currently not fully implemented or linked in the HTML.

## Architecture & Patterns

- The project is a single-page static site. There are no frameworks, build tools, or external dependencies.
- All resources (`a.css`, `a.js`) are expected to be in the project root and referenced directly from `a.html`.
- JavaScript is currently written both inline (in HTML `onclick` attributes) and in a separate file (`a.js`).
- CSS uses element, class, and ID selectors. Example: `.armando` for class, `#para1` for ID.

## Key Conventions

- Inline event handlers are used in HTML for button actions. Example:
  ```html
  <button
    type="button"
    onclick='document.getElementById("para1").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!"'
  >
    Click Me!
  </button>
  ```
- The CSS file sets background color, text alignment, and colors for specific elements/classes.
- JavaScript in `a.js` is not currently functional. To use external JS, ensure the script is linked in the HTML (uncomment the script tag) and functions are properly implemented.

## Developer Workflows

- No build or test steps are required; simply open `a.html` in a browser to view changes.
- To use external JavaScript, uncomment the script tag in the HTML head:
  ```html
  <script src="a.js" defer></script>
  ```
- For dynamic behavior, prefer moving inline JS to `a.js` and using `addEventListener` for maintainability.

## Examples

- To change the text of the paragraph with id `para1` via JS:
  ```js
  document.getElementById("para1").innerHTML = "Hello JavaScript!";
  ```
- To change its color:
  ```js
  document.getElementById("para1").style.color = "orange";
  ```

## Recommendations

- Keep all resources in the project root for simplicity.
- Use external JS for complex logic; keep HTML clean by avoiding inline event handlers when possible.
- No special build, test, or deployment steps are needed.
